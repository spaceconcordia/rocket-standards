\section{Preamble}
The following is a collection of standards and best practices compiled by Canadian rocketry teams based on their experiences with research, design, manufacturing, and testing in a variety of areas. This document is intended as a resource for teams to consult when evaluating their rockets and making design or project decisions, in order to pursue their objectives in the safest and most effective way possible.

This resource is not intended as a binding document on any team. It is understood that every team encounters new and unique problems, both technical and operational, through the course of their work, and the solutions documented here are by no means the best solution for every problem. Teams are encouraged to research and experiment when facing their own challenges, and to contribute to this document if they wish to share any knowledge they have gained through their experience.

This document is organized into a few subheadings now, if you think we need another one just add it. Feel free to add content directly, however, if you see an error or would like to suggest a change use comments or “suggested changes” mode.
