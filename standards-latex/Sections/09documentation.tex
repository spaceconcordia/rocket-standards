\begin{itemize}
\item Documentation exists for 2 reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Help people use your system. So write a user's guide, make it simple enough that people who have never seen a rocket before can operate your system
\item Help people fix your system when it invariably breaks (Murphy's law applies doubly in rocket science). You, as the designer, are responsible for knowing how your system can fail, how to diagnose every failure mode, and how to fix it. Assume that the person who needs to fix your gear has never met you before. They should still be able to fix it.
\end{enumerate}
