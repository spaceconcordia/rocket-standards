\subsection{General Safety Guidelines}
\begin{itemize}
\item If your payload contains electrical components, make sure your payload wiring doesn't come close to your avionics/recovery wiring. If the wiring does does, then it should also be meet or exceed the Safety Critical wiring standard that IREC publishes. You can find that standard here \url{http://www.soundingrocket.org/uploads/9/0/6/4/9064598/wiring_guidelines_v3.pdf}
\item If you have a deployable payload, its recovery system should be subject to the same level of testing that your main rocketry recovery system is. Redundant electrics, flawless tests, etc. 
\end{itemize}
