%\section*{Abstract}
\begin{abstract}
The following document is a compiled set of standards and best practices that the Canadian Teams have agreed to abide by and contribute to. The goal of the document is to provide standards which ensure the safe operations of the Canadian rocketry teams, and the successful operation of their rockets, so that they may remain competitive at whatever international competition they choose to participate in (in the case of this document, the chosen competition is the Spaceport America Cup). The document will also provide the best practices for designing, analyzing, manufacturing and testing a rocket to provide the best possible performance in competition. The document will be maintained and updated by the Canadian teams, who will make sure the methods presented herein are the most recent and effective, and that new methods and mechanisms are documented for the use of other Canadian teams.
