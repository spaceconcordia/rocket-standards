\begin{itemize}
\item IREC requires that your static margin off the rail is at least 1.0
\item However, if your predictions/simulations only give you a stability factor of 1, bear in mind that your actual flight may show a lower thrust than expected from testing.
\item This may adversely impact your speed off the rail, and drop your margin below 1. Be aware, and plan for that.
\end{itemize}
