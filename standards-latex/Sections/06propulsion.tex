\subsection{General Safety Guidelines}
\begin{itemize}
\item This will vary wildly based on your propulsion mechanism. Iâ€™m not an expert in this area, but the only advice that I feel qualified to give is that if you are building your own engine, please conduct at least 2 static test fires of it if possible, as close to launch condition as is possible. 
\item During static fires, maintain the same level of care as you would when performing a full flight. Draft procedures and checklists, and follow them as if you were at competition. These tests can be more than just validation for your engine, they can also validate your operations checklists, which is also extremely valuable.
